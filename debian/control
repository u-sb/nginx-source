 model.

Package: libnginx-mod-http-ndk
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Nginx Development Kit module
 The NDK is an Nginx module that is designed to extend the core functionality of
 the excellent Nginx webserver in a way that can be used as a basis of other
 Nginx modules.
 .
 It has functions and macros to deal with generic tasks that don't currently
 have generic code as part of the core distribution. The NDK itself adds few
 features that are seen from a user's point of view - it's just designed to help
 reduce the code that Nginx module developers need to write.  Embed LUA runtime
 into nginx.

Package: libnginx-mod-nchan
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Fast, flexible pub/sub server for Nginx
 Nchan is a scalable, flexible pub/sub server for the modern web, It can be
 configured as a standalone server, or as a shim between your application and
 tens, thousands, or millions of live subscribers. It can buffer messages in
 memory, on-disk, or via Redis. All connections are handled asynchronously and
 distributed among any number of worker processes. It can also scale to many
 nginx server instances with Redis.
 .

Package: libnginx-mod-http-echo
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Bring echo and more shell style goodies to Nginx
 Echo module wraps lots of Nginx internal APIs for streaming input and output,
 parallel/sequential subrequests, timers and sleeping, as well as various meta
 data accessing.
 .
 Basically it provides various utilities that help testing and debugging of
 other modules by trivially emulating different kinds of faked subrequest
 locations.
 .
 People will also find it useful in real-world applications that need to:
 .
 1. Serve static contents directly from memory.
 2. Wrap the upstream response with custom header and footer (kinda like the
    addition module but with contents read directly from the config file and
    Nginx variables).
 3. Merge contents of various "Nginx locations" (i.e., subrequests) together in
    a single main request (using echo_location and its friends).

Package: libnginx-mod-http-upstream-fair
Architecture: any

Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Upload progress system for Nginx
 Upload progress module is an implementation of an upload progress system, that
 monitors RFC1867 POST uploads as they are transmitted to upstream servers.

 in Javscript, Json or any other format.

Package: libnginx-mod-http-subs-filter
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Substitution filter module for Nginx
