<h2 class=sh>Introduction</h2>

<p class=pp>
This is a tale of two approaches to regular expression matching.
One of them is in widespread use in the
standard interpreters for many languages, including Perl.
The other is used only in a few places, notably most implementations
of awk and grep.
The two approaches have wildly different
performance characteristics:

</center>
</div>

<p class=lp>
Let's use superscripts to denote string repetition,
so that 
<code>a?<sup>3</sup>a<sup>3</sup></code>
is shorthand for
<code>a?a?a?aaa</code>.
The two graphs plot the time required by each approach
to match the regular expression 
<code>a?</code><sup><i>n</i></sup><code>a</code><sup><i>n</i></sup>
against the string <code>a</code><sup><i>n</i></sup>.
</p>

<p class=pp>
Notice that Perl requires over sixty seconds to match
a 29-character string.
The other approach, labeled Thompson NFA for
reasons that will be explained later,
requires twenty <i>microseconds</i> to match the string.
That's not a typo.  The Perl graph plots time in seconds,
while the Thompson NFA graph plots time in microseconds:
the Thompson NFA implementation
is a million times faster than Perl
when running on a miniscule 29-character string.
The trends shown in the graph continue: the
Thompson NFA handles a 100-character string in under 200 microseconds,
while Perl would require over 10<sup>15</sup> years.
(Perl is only the most conspicuous example of a large
number of popular programs that use the same algorithm;
the above graph could have been Python, or PHP, or Ruby,
or many other languages.  A more detailed
graph later in this article presents data for other implementations.)
</p>

<p class=pp>
It may be hard to believe the graphs: perhaps you've used Perl,
and it never seemed like regular expression matching was
particularly slow.
Most of the time, in fact, regular expression matching in Perl
is fast enough.  
As the graph shows, though, it is possible
to write so-called &ldquo;pathological&rdquo; regular expressions that
Perl matches very <i>very</i> slowly.
In contrast, there are no regular expressions that are 
pathological for the Thompson NFA implementation.
Seeing the two graphs side by side prompts the question, 
&ldquo;why doesn't Perl use the Thompson NFA approach?&rdquo;
It can, it should, and that's what the rest of this article is about.
</p>

<p class=pp>
Historically, regular expressions are one of computer science's
shining examples of how using good theory leads to good programs.
They were originally developed by theorists as a
simple computational model,
but Ken Thompson introduced them to
programmers in his implementation of the text editor QED
for CTSS.
Dennis Ritchie followed suit in his own implementation
of QED, for GE-TSS.
Thompson and Ritchie would go on to create Unix,
and they brought regular expressions with them.
By the late 1970s, regular expressions were a key
feature of the Unix landscape, in tools such as
ed, sed, grep, egrep, awk, and lex.
</p>

<p class=pp>
Today, regular expressions have also become a shining
example of how ignoring good theory leads to bad programs.
The regular expression implementations used by
today's popular tools are significantly slower
than the ones used in many of those thirty-year-old Unix tools.
</p>

<p class=pp>
This article reviews the good theory: 
regular expressions, finite automata, 
and a regular expression search algorithm
invented by Ken Thompson in the mid-1960s.
It also puts the theory into practice, describing 
a simple implementation of Thompson's algorithm.
That implementation, less than 400 lines of C,
is the one that went head to head with Perl above.
It outperforms the more complex real-world
implementations used by
Perl, Python, PCRE, and others.
The article concludes with a discussion of how 
theory might yet be converted into practice
in the real-world implementations.

<h2 class=sh>
Regular Expressions
</h2>


<p class=pp>
Regular expressions are a notation for
describing sets of character strings.
When a particular string is in the set
described by a regular expression,
we often say that the regular expression
<i>matches</i>
the string.
</p>

<p class=pp>
The simplest regular expression is a single literal character.
Except for the special metacharacters 
<code>*+?()|</code>,
characters match themselves.
To match a metacharacter, escape it with
a backslash:
<code>\+</code>
matches a literal plus character.
</p>

<p class=pp>
Two regular expressions can be alternated or concatenated to form a new
regular expression:
if <i>e</i><sub>1</sub> matches
<i>s</i>
and <i>e</i><sub>2</sub> matches
<i>t</i>,
then <i>e</i><sub>1</sub><code>|</code><i>e</i><sub>2</sub> matches
<i>s</i>
or
<i>t</i>,
and
<i>e</i><sub>1</sub><i>e</i><sub>2</sub>
matches 
<i>st</i>.
</p>

<p class=pp>
The metacharacters
<code>*</code>,
<code>+</code>,
and
<code>?</code>
are repetition operators:
<i>e</i><sub>1</sub><code>*</code>
matches a sequence of zero or more (possibly different)
strings, each of which match <i>e</i><sub>1</sub>;
<i>e</i><sub>1</sub><code>+</code>
matches one or more; 
<i>e</i><sub>1</sub><code>?</code>
matches zero or one.
</p>

<p class=pp>
The operator precedence, from weakest to strongest binding, is
first alternation, then concatenation, and finally the
repetition operators.
Explicit parentheses can be used to force different meanings,
just as in arithmetic expressions.
Some examples:
<code>ab|cd</code>
is equivalent to
<code>(ab)|(cd)</code>;
<code>ab*</code>
is equivalent to
<code>a(b*)</code>.
</p>

<p class=pp>
The syntax described so far is a subset of the traditional Unix
egrep
regular expression syntax.
This subset suffices to describe all regular
languages: loosely speaking, a regular language is a set
of strings that can be matched in a single pass through
the text using only a fixed amount of memory.
Newer regular expression facilities (notably Perl and
those that have copied it) have added 
<a href="http://www.perl.com/doc/manual/html/pod/perlre.html">many new operators
and escape sequences</a>.  These additions make the regular
expressions more concise, and sometimes more cryptic, but usually
not more powerful:
these fancy new regular expressions almost always have longer
equivalents using the traditional syntax.
</p>

<p class=pp>
One common regular expression extension that 
does provide additional power is called
<i>backreferences</i>.
A backreference like
<code>\1</code>
or
<code>\2</code>
matches the string matched
by a previous parenthesized expression, and only that string:
<code>(cat|dog)\1</code>
matches
<code>catcat</code>
and
<code>dogdog</code>
but not
<code>catdog</code>
nor
<code>dogcat</code>.
As far as the theoretical term is concerned,
regular expressions with backreferences
are not regular expressions.
The power that backreferences add comes at great cost:
in the worst case, the best known implementations require
exponential search algorithms,
like the one Perl uses.
Perl (and the other languages)
could not now remove backreference support,
of course, but they could employ much faster algorithms
when presented with regular expressions that don't have
backreferences, like the ones considered above.
This article is about those faster algorithms.
</p>

<h2 class=sh>
Finite Automata
</h2>



<p class=pp>
Another way to describe sets of character strings is with
finite automata.
Finite automata are also known as state machines,
and we will use &ldquo;automaton&rdquo; and &ldquo;machine&rdquo; interchangeably.
</p>

<p class=pp>
As a simple example, here is a machine recognizing
the set of strings matched by the regular expression
<code>a(bb)+a</code>:
</p>

<p class=fig><img src=fig0.png alt="DFA for a(bb)+a" width="278" height="54"></p>

<p class=pp>
A finite automaton is always in one of its states,
represented in the diagram by circles.
(The numbers inside the circles are labels to make this
discussion easier; they are not part of the machine's operation.)
As it reads the string, it switches from state to state.
This machine has two special states: the start state <i>s</i><sub>0</sub>
and the matching state <i>s</i><sub>4</sub>.
Start states are depicted with lone arrowheads pointing at them,
and matching states are drawn as a double circle.
</p>

<p class=pp>
The machine reads an input string one character at a time,
following arrows corresponding to the input to move from
state to state.
Suppose the input string is
<code>abbbba</code>.
When the machine reads the first letter of the string, the
<code>a</code>,
it is in the start state <i>s</i><sub>0</sub>.  It follows the
<code>a</code>
arrow to state <i>s</i><sub>1</sub>.
This process repeats as the machine reads the rest of the string:
<code>b</code>
to
<code><i>s</i><sub>2</sub></code>,
<code>b</code>
to
<code><i>s</i><sub>3</sub></code>,
<code>b</code>
to
<code><i>s</i><sub>2</sub></code>,
<code>b</code>
to
<code><i>s</i><sub>3</sub></code>,
and finally
<code>a</code>
to
<code><i>s</i><sub>4</sub></code>.
</p>
<p class=fig><img src=fig1.png alt="DFA execution on abbbba" width="357" height="426"></p>
<p class=lp>
The machine ends in <i>s</i><sub>4</sub>, a matching state, so it
matches the string.
If the machine ends in a non-matching state, it does not 
match the string.
If, at any point during the machine's execution, there is no
arrow for it to follow corresponding to the current
input character, the machine stops executing early.
</p>

<p class=pp>
The machine we have been considering is called a
<i>deterministic</i>
finite automaton (DFA),
because in any state, each possible input letter
leads to at most one new state.
We can also create machines
that must choose between multiple possible next states.
For example, this machine is equivalent to the previous
one but is not deterministic:
</p>
<p class=fig><img src=fig2.png alt="NFA for a(bb)+a" width="278" height="54"></p>
<p class=lp>
The machine is not deterministic because if it reads a
<code>b</code>
in state <i>s</i><sub>2</sub>, it has multiple choices for the next state:
it can go back to <i>s</i><sub>1</sub> in hopes of seeing another
<code>bb</code>,
or it can go on to <i>s</i><sub>3</sub> in hopes of seeing the final
<code>a</code>.
Since the machine cannot peek ahead to see the rest of
the string, it has no way to know which is the correct decision.
In this situation, it turns out to be interesting to
let the machine
<i>always guess correctly</i>.
Such machines are called non-deterministic finite automata
(NFAs or NDFAs).
An NFA matches an input string if there is some way 
it can read the string and follow arrows to a matching state.
</p>

<p class=pp>
Sometimes it is convenient to let NFAs have arrows with no
corresponding input character.  We will leave these arrows unlabeled.
An NFA can, at any time, choose to follow an unlabeled arrow
without reading any input.
This NFA is equivalent to the previous two, but the unlabeled arrow
makes the correspondence with
<code>a(bb)+a</code>
clearest:
</p>
<p class=fig><img src=fig3.png alt="Another NFA for a(bb)+a" width="278" height="39"></p>

<h2 class=sh>
Converting Regular Expressions to NFAs
</h2>

<p class=pp>
Regular expressions and NFAs turn out to be exactly
equivalent in power: every regular expression has an
equivalent NFA (they match the same strings) and vice versa.
(It turns out that DFAs are also equivalent in power 
to NFAs and regular expressions; we will see this later.)
There are multiple ways to translate regular expressions into NFAs.
The method described here was first described by Thompson
in his 1968 CACM paper.
</p>

<p class=pp>
The NFA for a regular expression is built up from partial NFAs
for each subexpression, with a different construction for
each operator.  The partial NFAs have
no matching states: instead they have one or more dangling arrows,
pointing to nothing.  The construction process will finish by
connecting these arrows to a matching state.
</p>

<p class=pp>
The NFAs for matching single characters look like:
</p>
<p class=fig><img src=fig4.png alt="Single-character NFA" width="113" height="21"></p>
<p class=lp>
The NFA for the concatenation <i>e</i><sub>1</sub><i>e</i><sub>2</sub>
connects the final arrow of the <i>e</i><sub>1</sub> 
machine to the start of the <i>e</i><sub>2</sub> machine:
</p>
<p class=fig><img src=fig5.png alt="Concatenation NFA" width="242" height="20"></p>
<p class=lp>
The NFA for the alternation <i>e</i><sub>1</sub><code>|</code><i>e</i><sub>2</sub>
adds a new start state with a choice of either the
<i>e</i><sub>1</sub> machine or the <i>e</i><sub>2</sub> machine.
</p>
<p class=fig><img src=fig6.png alt="Alternation NFA" width="202" height="62"></p>
<p class=lp>
The NFA for <i>e</i><code>?</code> alternates the <i>e</i> machine with an empty path:
</p>
<p class=fig><img src=fig7.png alt="Zero or one NFA" width="184" height="56"></p>
<p class=lp>
The NFA for <i>e</i><code>*</code> uses the same alternation but loops a 
matching <i>e</i> machine back to the start:
</p>
<p class=fig><img src=fig8.png alt="Zero or more NFA" width="184" height="56"></p>
<p class=lp>
The NFA for <i>e</i><code>+</code> also creates a loop, but one that
requires passing through <i>e</i> at least once:
</p>
<p class=fig><img src=fig9.png alt="One or more NFA" width="190" height="41"></p>

<p class=pp>
Counting the new states in the diagrams above, we can see
that this technique creates exactly one state per character
or metacharacter in the regular expression,
excluding parentheses.
Therefore the number of states in the final NFA is at most
equal to the length of the original regular expression.
</p>

<p class=pp>
Just as with the example NFA discussed earlier, it is always possible
to remove the unlabeled arrows, and it is also always possible to generate
the NFA without the unlabeled arrows in the first place.
Having the unlabeled arrows makes the NFA easier for us to read
and understand, and they also make the C representation
simpler, so we will keep them.
</p>

<h2 class=sh>
Regular Expression Search Algorithms
</h2>

<p class=pp>
Now we have a way to test whether a regular expression
matches a string: convert the regular expression to an NFA
and then run the NFA using the string as input.
Remember that NFAs are endowed with the ability to guess
perfectly when faced with a choice of next state:
to run the NFA using an ordinary computer, we must find
a way to simulate this guessing.
</p>

<p class=pp>
One way to simulate perfect guessing is to guess
one option, and if that doesn't work, try the other.
For example, consider the NFA for
<code>abab|abbb</code>
run on the string
<code>abbb</code>:
</p>
<p class=fig><img src=fig10.png alt="NFA for abab|abbb" width="364" height="79"></p>
<p class=fig><img src=fig11.png alt="Backtracking execution on abbb" width="729" height="619"></p>
<p class=lp>
At step 0, the NFA must make a choice: try to match
<code>abab</code>
or
try to match
<code>abbb</code>?
In the diagram, the NFA tries
<code>abab</code>,
but that fails after step 3.
The NFA then tries the other choice, leading to step 4 and eventually a match.
This backtracking approach
has a simple recursive implementation
but can read the input string many times
before succeeding.
If the string does not match,
the machine must try
<i>all</i>
possible execution paths before
giving up.
The NFA tried only two different paths in the example,
but in the worst case, there can be exponentially
many possible execution paths, leading to very slow run times.
</p>

<p class=pp>
A more efficient but more complicated way to simulate perfect
guessing is to guess both options simultaneously. 
In this approach, the simulation allows the machine
to be in multiple states at once.  To process each letter,
it advances all the states along all the arrows that
match the letter.
</p>
<p class=fig><img src=fig12.png alt="Parallel execution on abbb" width="329" height="511"></p>
<p class=lp>
The machine starts in the start state and all the states
reachable from the start state by unlabeled arrows.
In steps 1 and 2, the NFA is in two states simultaneously.
Only at step 3 does the state set narrow down to a single state.
This multi-state approach tries both paths at the same time,
reading the input only once.
In the worst case, the NFA might be in
<i>every</i>
state at each step, but this results in at worst a constant amount
of work independent of the length of the string,
so arbitrarily
large input strings can be processed in linear time.
This is a dramatic improvement over the exponential time
required by the backtracking approach.
The efficiency comes from tracking the set of reachable
states but
<i>not</i>
which paths were used to reach them.
In an NFA with 
<i>n</i>
nodes, there can only be 
<i>n</i>
reachable states at any step, but there might be
2<sup><i>n</i></sup> paths through the NFA.
</p>

<h2 class=sh>
Implementation
</h2>

<p class=pp>
Thompson introduced the multiple-state simulation approach
in his 1968 paper.
In his formulation, the states of the NFA were represented
by small machine-code sequences, and the list of possible states
was just a sequence of function call instructions.
In essence, Thompson compiled the regular expression into clever
machine code.
Forty years later, computers are much faster and the 
machine code approach is not as necessary.
The following sections
present an implementation written in portable ANSI C.
The full source code (under 400 lines)
and the benchmarking scripts are 
<a href="http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/">available online</a>.
(Readers who are unfamiliar or uncomfortable with C or pointers should
feel free to read the descriptions and skip over the actual code.)
</p>

<h2 class=sh id="compiling">
Implementation: Compiling to NFA
</h2>

<p class=pp>
The first step is to compile the regular expression
into an equivalent NFA.
In our C program, we will represent an NFA as a
linked collection of 
<code>State</code>
structures:
</p>
<pre class=p1>
struct State
{
	int c;
	State *out;
	State *out1;
	int lastlist;
};
</pre><p class=lp>
Each
<code>State</code>
represents one of the following three NFA fragments,
depending on the value of
<code>c</code>.
</p>
<p class=fig><img src=fig13.png alt="Possible per-State NFA fragments" width="340" height="109"></p>
<p class=lp>
(<code>Lastlist</code>
is used during execution and is explained in the next section.)
</p>

<p class=pp>
Following Thompson's paper,
the compiler builds an NFA from a regular expression in
<i>postfix</i>
notation with dot
(<code>.</code>) added
as an explicit concatenation operator.
A separate function
<code>re2post</code>
rewrites infix regular expressions like
&ldquo;<code>a(bb)+a</code>&rdquo;
into equivalent postfix expressions like
&ldquo;<code>abb.+.a.</code>&rdquo;.
(A &ldquo;real&rdquo; implementation would certainly
need to use dot as the &ldquo;any character&rdquo; metacharacter
rather than as a concatenation operator.
A real implementation would also probably build the 
NFA during parsing rather than build an explicit postfix expression.
However, the postfix version is convenient and follows 
Thompson's paper more closely.)
</p>

<p class=pp>
As the compiler scans the postfix expression, it maintains
a stack of computed NFA fragments.
Literals push new NFA fragments onto the stack, while
operators pop fragments off the stack and then
push a new fragment.
For example, 
after compiling the
<code>abb</code> in <code>abb.+.a.</code>,
the stack contains NFA fragments for
<code>a</code>,
<code>b</code>,
and
<code>b</code>.
The compilation of the
<code>.</code>
that follows pops the two
<code>b</code>
NFA fragment from the stack and pushes an NFA fragment for the
concatenation
<code>bb.</code>.
Each NFA fragment is defined by its start state and its
outgoing arrows:
</p><pre class=p1>
struct Frag
{
	State *start;
	Ptrlist *out;
};
</pre><p class=lp>
<code>Start</code>
points at the start state for the fragment,
and
<code>out</code>
is a list of pointers to 
<code>State*</code>
pointers that are not yet connected to anything.
These are the dangling arrows in the NFA fragment.
</p>

<p class=pp>
Some helper functions manipulate pointer lists:
</p><pre class=p1>
Ptrlist *list1(State **outp);
Ptrlist *append(Ptrlist *l1, Ptrlist *l2);

void patch(Ptrlist *l, State *s);
</pre><p class=lp>
<code>List1</code>
creates a new pointer list containing the single pointer
<code>outp</code>.
<code>Append</code>
concatenates two pointer lists, returning the result.
<code>Patch</code>
connects the dangling arrows in the pointer list
<code>l</code>
to the state
<code>s</code>:
it sets
<code>*outp</code>
<code>=</code>
<code>s</code>
for each pointer
<code>outp</code>
in
<code>l</code>.
</p>

<p class=pp>
Given these primitives and a fragment stack,
the compiler is a simple loop over the postfix expression.
At the end, there is a single fragment left:
patching in a matching state completes the NFA.
</p><pre class=p1>
State*
post2nfa(char *postfix)
{
	char *p;
	Frag stack[1000], *stackp, e1, e2, e;
	State *s;

	#define push(s) *stackp++ = s
	#define pop()   *--stackp

	stackp = stack;
	for(p=postfix; *p; p++){
		switch(*p){
		/* <i>compilation cases, described below</i> */
		}
	}
	
	e = pop();
	patch(e.out, matchstate);
	return e.start;
}
</pre><p class=lp><a id="compile"></a>
The specific compilation cases mimic the translation 
steps described earlier.

Implementation: Simulating the NFA
</h2>

<p class=pp>
Now that the NFA has been built, we need to simulate it.
The simulation requires tracking 
<code>State</code>
sets, which are stored as a simple array list:
</p><pre class=p1>
struct List
{
	State **s;
	int n;
};
</pre><p class=lp>
The simulation uses two lists:
<code>clist</code>
is the current set of states that the NFA is in,
and
<code>nlist</code>
is the next set of states that the NFA will be in,
after processing the current character.
The execution loop initializes
<code>clist</code>
to contain just the start state and then
runs the machine one step at a time.
</p><pre class=p1>
int
match(State *start, char *s)
{
	List *clist, *nlist, *t;

	/* l1 and l2 are preallocated globals */
	clist = startlist(start, &amp;l1);
	nlist = &amp;l2;
	for(; *s; s++){
		step(clist, *s, nlist);
		t = clist; clist = nlist; nlist = t;	/* swap clist, nlist */
	}
	return ismatch(clist);
}
</pre><p class=lp>
To avoid allocating on every iteration of the loop,
<code>match</code>
uses two preallocated lists
<code>l1</code>
and
<code>l2</code>
as
<code>clist</code>
and
<code>nlist</code>,
swapping the two after each step.
</p>

<p class=pp>
If the final state list contains the matching state,
then the string matches.
</p><pre class=p1>
int
ismatch(List *l)
{
	int i;

	for(i=0; i&lt;l-&gt;n; i++)
		if(l-&gt;s[i] == matchstate)
			return 1;
	return 0;
}
</pre><p class=lp>
</p>

<p class=pp>
<code>Addstate</code>
adds a state to the list,
but not if it is already on the list.
Scanning the entire list for each add would be inefficient;
instead the variable
<code>listid</code>
acts as a list generation number.
When
<code>addstate</code>
adds
<code>s</code>
to a list,
it records
<code>listid</code>
in
<code>s->lastlist</code>.
If the two are already equal,
then 
<code>s</code>
is already on the list being built.
<code>Addstate</code>
also follows unlabeled arrows:
if 
<code>s</code>
is a
<code>Split</code>
state with two unlabeled arrows to new states,
<code>addstate</code>
adds those states to the list instead of
<code>s</code>.
</p><pre class=p1>
void
addstate(List *l, State *s)
{
	if(s == NULL || s-&gt;lastlist == listid)
		return;
	s-&gt;lastlist = listid;
	if(s-&gt;c == Split){
		/* follow unlabeled arrows */
		addstate(l, s-&gt;out);
		addstate(l, s-&gt;out1);
		return;
	}
	l-&gt;s[l-&gt;n++] = s;
}
</pre><p class=lp>
</p>

<p class=pp>
<code>Startlist</code>
creates an initial state list by adding just the start state:
</p><pre class=p1>
List*
startlist(State *s, List *l)
{
	listid++;
	l-&gt;n = 0;
	addstate(l, s);
	return l;
}
</pre><p class=lp>
</p>

<p class=pp>
Finally,
<code>step</code>
advances the NFA past a single character, using
the current list
<code>clist</code>
to compute the next list
<code>nlist</code>.
</p><pre class=p1>
void
step(List *clist, int c, List *nlist)
{
	int i;
	State *s;

	listid++;
	nlist-&gt;n = 0;
	for(i=0; i&lt;clist-&gt;n; i++){
		s = clist-&gt;s[i];
		if(s-&gt;c == c)
			addstate(nlist, s-&gt;out);
	}
}
</pre>

<h2 class=sh>
Performance
</h2>

<p class=pp>
The C implementation just described was not written with performance in mind.
Even so, a slow implementation of a linear-time algorithm
can easily outperform a fast implementation of an 
exponential-time algorithm once the exponent is large enough.
Testing a variety of popular regular expression engines on 
a so-called pathological regular expression demonstrates this nicely.
</p>

<p class=pp>
Consider the regular expression
<code>a?<sup><i>n</i></sup>a<sup><i>n</i></sup></code>.
It matches the string
<code>a<sup><i>n</i></sup></code>
when the
<code>a?</code>
are chosen not to match any letters,
leaving the entire string to be matched by the
<code>a<sup><i>n</i></sup></code>.
Backtracking regular expression implementations
implement the zero-or-one
<code>?</code>
by first trying one and then zero.
There are
<i>n</i>
such choices to make, a total of
2<sup><i>n</i></sup> possibilities.
Only the very last
possibility&mdash;choosing zero for all the <code>?</code>&mdash;will lead to a match.
The backtracking approach thus requires
<i>O</i>(2<sup><i>n</i></sup>) time, so it will not scale much beyond <i>n</i>=25.
</p>

<p class=pp>
In contrast, Thompson's algorithm maintains state lists of length
approximately <i>n</i> and processes the string, also of length <i>n</i>,
for a total of <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>) time.
(The run time is superlinear,
because we are not keeping the regular expression constant
as the input grows.
For a regular expression of length <i>m</i> run on text of length <i>n</i>,
the Thompson NFA requires <i>O</i>(<i>mn</i>) time.)
</p>

<p class=pp>
The following graph plots time required to check whether
<code>a?<sup><i>n</i></sup>a<sup><i>n</i></sup></code>
matches
<code>a<sup><i>n</i></sup></code>:
</p>

<div class=fig>
<center>
<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0><tr><td>
<div class=box>
<center>
<img src=grep1p.png alt="Performance graph" width="779" height="388">
<br>
regular expression and text size <i>n</i>
<br>
<code>a?</code><sup><i>n</i></sup><code>a</code><sup><i>n</i></sup>
matching 
<code>a</code><sup><i>n</i></sup>
</center>
</div>
</table>
</center>
</div>

<p class=lp>
Notice that the graph's <i>y</i>-axis has a logarithmic scale,
in order to be able to see a wide variety of times on a single graph.
</p>

<p class=pp>
From the graph it is clear that Perl, PCRE, Python, and Ruby are
all using recursive backtracking.
PCRE stops getting the right answer at 
<i>n</i>=23,
because it aborts the recursive backtracking after a maximum number
of steps.
As of Perl 5.6, Perl's regular expression engine is
<a href="http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=502408">said to memoize</a>
the recursive backtracking search, which should, at some memory cost,
keep the search from taking exponential amounts of time 
unless backreferences are being used.
As the performance graph shows, the memoization is not complete:
Perl's run time grows exponentially even though there
are no backreferences
in the expression.
Although not benchmarked here, Java uses a backtracking
implementation too.
In fact, the
<code>java.util.regex</code>
interface requires a backtracking
implementation, because arbitrary Java code
can be substituted into the matching path.
PHP uses the PCRE library.
</p>

<p class=pp>
The thick blue line is the C implementation of Thompson's algorithm given above.
Awk, Tcl, GNU grep, and GNU awk 
build DFAs, either precomputing them or using the on-the-fly
construction described in the next section.
</p>

<p class=pp>
Some might argue that this test is unfair to
the backtracking implementations, since it focuses on an
uncommon corner case.
This argument misses the point:
given a choice between an implementation
with a predictable, consistent, fast running time on all inputs
or one that usually runs quickly but can take
years of CPU time (or more) on some inputs,
the decision should be easy.
Also, while examples as dramatic as this one
rarely occur in practice, less dramatic ones do occur.
Examples include using
<code>(.*)</code>
<code>(.*)</code>
<code>(.*)</code>
<code>(.*)</code>
<code>(.*)</code>
to split five space-separated fields, or using
alternations where the common cases
are not listed first.
As a result, programmers often learn which constructs are
expensive and avoid them, or they turn to so-called
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~dankogai/Regexp-Optimizer-0.15/lib/Regexp/Optimizer.pm">optimizers</a>.
Using Thompson's NFA simulation does not require such adaptation:
there are no expensive regular expressions.
</p>

<h2 class=sh>
Caching the NFA to build a DFA
</h2>

<p class=pp>
Recall that DFAs are more efficient to execute than NFAs,
because DFAs are only ever in one state at a time: they never
have a choice of multiple next states.
Any NFA can be converted into an equivalent DFA
in which each DFA state corresponds to a
list of NFA states.
</p>

<p class=pp>
For example, here is the NFA we used earlier for
<code>abab|abbb</code>,
with state numbers added:
</p>
<p class=fig><img src=fig20.png alt="NFA for abab|abbb" width="424" height="91"></p>
<p class=lp>
The equivalent DFA would be:
</p>
<p class=fig><img src=fig21.png alt="DFA for abab|abbb" width="496" height="170"></p>
<p class=lp>
Each state in the DFA corresponds to a list of 
states from the NFA.
</p>

<p class=pp>
In a sense, Thompson's NFA simulation is
executing the equivalent DFA: each
<code>List</code>
corresponds to some DFA state,
and the 
<code>step</code>
function is computing, given a list and a next character,
the next DFA state to enter.
Thompson's algorithm simulates the DFA by 
reconstructing each DFA state as it is needed.
Rather than throw away this work after each step,
we could cache the
<code>Lists</code>
in spare memory, avoiding the cost of repeating the computation
in the future
and essentially computing the equivalent DFA as it is needed.
This section presents the implementation of such an approach.
Starting with the NFA implementation from the previous section,
we need to add less than 100 lines to build a DFA implementation.
</p>

<p class=pp>
To implement the cache, we first introduce a new data type
that represents a DFA state:
</p><pre class=p1>
struct DState
{
	List l;
	DState *next[256];
	DState *left;
	DState *right;
};
</pre><p class=lp>
A
<code>DState</code>
is the cached copy of the list
<code>l</code>.
The array
<code>next</code>
contains pointers to the next state for each
possible input character:
if the current state is
<code>d</code>
and the next input character is
<code>c</code>,
then
<code>d->next[c]</code>
is the next state.
If
<code>d->next[c]</code>
is null, then the next state has not been computed yet.
<code>Nextstate</code>
computes, records, and returns the next state
for a given state and character.
</p>

<p class=pp>
The regular expression match follows
<code>d->next[c]</code>
repeatedly, calling
<code>nextstate</code>
to compute new states as needed.
</p><pre class=p1>
int
match(DState *start, char *s)
{
	int c;
	DState *d, *next;
	
	d = start;
	for(; *s; s++){
		c = *s &amp; 0xFF;
		if((next = d-&gt;next[c]) == NULL)
			next = nextstate(d, c);
		d = next;
	}
	return ismatch(&amp;d-&gt;l);
}
</pre><p class=lp>
</p>

<p class=pp>
All the
<code>DStates</code>
that have been computed need to be saved in a 
structure that lets us look up a
<code>DState</code>
by its
<code>List</code>.
To do this, we arrange them 
in a binary tree
using the sorted
<code>List</code>
as the key.
The
<code>dstate</code>
function returns the
<code>DState</code>
for a given
<code>List</code>,
allocating one if necessary:
</p><pre class=p1>
DState*
dstate(List *l)
{
	int i;
	DState **dp, *d;
	static DState *alldstates;

	qsort(l-&gt;s, l-&gt;n, sizeof l-&gt;s[0], ptrcmp);

	/* look in tree for existing DState */
	dp = &amp;alldstates;
	while((d = *dp) != NULL){
		i = listcmp(l, &amp;d-&gt;l);
		if(i &lt; 0)
			dp = &amp;d-&gt;left;
		else if(i &gt; 0)
			dp = &amp;d-&gt;right;
		else
			return d;
	}
	
	/* allocate, initialize new DState */
	d = malloc(sizeof *d + l-&gt;n*sizeof l-&gt;s[0]);
	memset(d, 0, sizeof *d);
	d-&gt;l.s = (State**)(d+1);
	memmove(d-&gt;l.s, l-&gt;s, l-&gt;n*sizeof l-&gt;s[0]);
	d-&gt;l.n = l-&gt;n;

	/* insert in tree */
	*dp = d;
	return d;
}
</pre><p class=lp>
Nextstate runs the NFA
<code>step</code>
and returns the corresponding
<code>DState</code>:
</p><pre class=p1>
DState*
nextstate(DState *d, int c)
{
	step(&amp;d-&gt;l, c, &amp;l1);
	return d-&gt;next[c] = dstate(&amp;l1);
}
</pre><p class=lp>
Finally, the DFA's start state is the
<code>DState</code>
corresponding to the NFA's start list:
</p><pre class=p1>
DState*
startdstate(State *start)
{
	return dstate(startlist(start, &amp;l1));
}
</pre><p class=lp>
(As in the NFA simulation,
<code>l1</code>
is a preallocated
<code>List</code>.)
</p>

<p class=pp>
The
<code>DStates</code>
correspond to DFA states, but the DFA is only built as needed:
if a DFA state has not been encountered during the search,
it does not yet exist in the cache.
An alternative would be to compute the entire DFA at once.
Doing so would make
<code>match</code>
a little faster by removing the conditional branch,
but at the cost of increased startup time and
memory use.
</p>

<p class=pp>
One might also worry about bounding the amount of
memory used by the on-the-fly DFA construction.
Since the
<code>DStates</code>
are only a cache of the 
<code>step</code>
function, the implementation of
<code>dstate</code>
could choose to throw away the entire DFA so far
if the cache grew too large.
This cache replacement policy 
only requires a few extra lines of code in 
<code>dstate</code>
and in
<code>nextstate</code>,
plus around 50 lines of code for memory management.
An implementation is
<a href="http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/">available online</a>.
(<a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/awkbook/">Awk</a>
uses a similar limited-size cache strategy,
with a fixed limit of 32 cached states; this explains the discontinuity
in its performance at <i>n</i>=28 in the graph above.)
</p>

<p class=pp>
NFAs derived from regular expressions
tend to exhibit good locality: they visit the same states
and follow the same transition arrows over and over
when run on most texts.
This makes the caching worthwhile: the first time an arrow
is followed, the next state must be computed as in the NFA
simulation, but future traversals of the arrow are just
a single memory access.
Real DFA-based implementations can make use
of additional optimizations to run even faster.
A companion article (not yet written) will explore
DFA-based regular expression implementations in more detail.

<h2 class=sh>
Real world regular expressions
</h2>

<p class=pp>
Regular expression usage in real programs
is somewhat more complicated than what the regular expression
implementations described above can handle.
This section briefly describes the common complications;
full treatment of any of these is beyond the scope of this
introductory article.
</p>

<p class=pp>
<i>Character classes</i>.
A character class, whether 
<code>[0-9]</code>
or
<code>\w</code>
or
<code>.</code> (dot),
is just a concise representation of an alternation.
Character classes can be expanded into alternations
during compilation, though it is more efficient to add
a new kind of NFA node to represent them explicitly.
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/xbd_chap09.html">POSIX</a>
defines special character classes
like <code>[[:upper:]]</code> that change meaning
depending on the current locale, but the hard part of
accommodating these is determining their meaning,
not encoding that meaning into an NFA.
</p>

<p class=pp>
<i>Escape sequences</i>.
Real regular expression syntaxes need to handle
escape sequences, both as a way to match metacharacters
(<code>\(</code>,
<code>\)</code>,
<code>\\</code>,
etc.)
and to specify otherwise difficult-to-type characters such as
<code>\n</code>.
</p>

<p class=pp>
<i>Counted repetition</i>.
Many regular expression implementations provide a counted
repetition operator
<code>{<i>n</i>}</code>
to match exactly 
<i>n</i>
strings matching a pattern;
<code>{</code><i>n</i><code>,</code><i>m</i><code>}</code>
to match at least 
<i>n</i>
but no more than
<i>m</i>;
and
<code>{</code><i>n</i><code>,}</code>
to match
<i>n</i>
or more.
A recursive backtracking implementation can implement
counted repetition using a loop; an NFA or DFA-based
implementation must expand the repetition:
<i>e</i><code>{3}</code>
expands to
<i>eee</i>;
<i>e</i><code>{3,5}</code>
expands to
<i>eeee</i><code>?</code><i>e</i><code>?</code>,
and
<i>e</i><code>{3,}</code>
expands to
<i>eee</i><code>+</code>.
</p>

<p class=pp>
<i>Submatch extraction</i>.
When regular expressions are used for splitting or parsing strings,
it is useful to be able to find out which sections of the input string
were matched by each subexpression.
After a regular expression like
<code>([0-9]+-[0-9]+-[0-9]+)</code>
<code>([0-9]+:[0-9]+)</code>
matches a string (say a date and time),
many regular expression engines make the
text matched by each parenthesized expression
available.
For example, one might write in Perl:
</p><pre class=p1>
if(/([0-9]+-[0-9]+-[0-9]+) ([0-9]+:[0-9]+)/){
	print "date: $1, time: $2\n";
}
</pre><p class=lp>
The extraction of submatch boundaries has been mostly ignored
by computer science theorists, and it is perhaps the most
compelling argument for using recursive backtracking.
However, Thompson-style algorithms can be adapted to
track submatch boundaries without giving up efficient performance.
The Eighth Edition Unix
<i>regexp</i>(3)
library implemented such an algorithm as early as 1985,
though as explained below,
it was not very widely used or even noticed.
</p>

<p class=pp>
<i>Unanchored matches</i>.
This article has assumed that regular expressions
are matched against an entire input string.
In practice, one often wishes to find a substring
of the input that matches the regular expression.
Unix tools traditionally return the longest matching substring
that starts at the leftmost possible point in the input.
An unanchored search for 
<i>e</i>
is a special case
of submatch extraction: it is like searching for
<code>.*(<i>e</i>).*</code>
where the first
<code>.*</code>
is constrained to match as short a string as possible.
</p>

<p class=pp>
<i>Non-greedy operators</i>.
In traditional Unix regular expressions, the repetition operators
<code>?</code>,
<code>*</code>,
and
<code>+</code>
are defined to match as much of the string as possible while
still allowing the entire regular expression to match:
when matching
<code>(.+)(.+)</code>
against
<code>abcd</code>,
the first
<code>(.+)</code>
will match
<code>abc</code>,
and the second
will match
<code>d</code>.
These operators are now called
<i>greedy</i>.
Perl introduced
<code>??</code>,
<code>*?</code>,
and
<code>+?</code>
as non-greedy versions, which match as little of the string
as possible while preserving the overall match:
when matching
<code>(.+?)(.+?)</code>
against
<code>abcd</code>,
the first
<code>(.+?)</code>
will match only
<code>a</code>,
and the second
will match
<code>bcd.</code>
By definition, whether an operator is greedy
cannot affect whether a regular expression matches a
particular string as a whole; it only affects the
choice of submatch boundaries.
The backtracking algorithm admits a simple implementation
of non-greedy operators:
try the shorter match before the longer one.
For example, in a standard backtracking implementation,
<code><i>e</i>?</code>
first tries using
<i>e</i>
and then tries not using it;
<code><i>e</i>??</code>
uses the other order.
The submatch-tracking variants of Thompson's algorithm
can be adapted to accommodate non-greedy operators.
</p>

<p class=pp>
<i>Assertions</i>.
The traditional regular expression metacharacters
<code>^</code>
and
<code>$</code>
can be viewed as
<i>assertions</i>
about the text around them:
<code>^</code>
asserts that the previous character
is a newline (or the beginning of the string),
while
<code>$</code>
asserts that the next character is a newline
(or the end of the string).
Perl added more assertions, like
the word boundary
<code>\b</code>,
which asserts that 
the previous character is alphanumeric but the next
is not, or vice versa.
Perl also generalized the idea to arbitrary
conditions called lookahead assertions:
<code>(?=</code><i>re</i><code>)</code>
asserts that the text after the current input position matches
<i>re</i>,
but does not actually advance the input position;
<code>(?!</code><i>re</i><code>)</code>
is similar but 
asserts that the text does not match
<i>re</i>.
The lookbehind assertions
<code>(?&lt;=</code><i>re</i><code>)</code>
and
<code>(?&lt;!</code><i>re</i><code>)</code>
are similar but make assertions about the text
before the current input position.
Simple assertions like
<code>^</code>,
<code>$</code>,
and
<code>\b</code>
are easy to accommodate in an NFA,
delaying the match one byte for forward assertions.
The generalized assertions
are harder to accommodate but in principle could
be encoded in the NFA.
</p>

<p class=pp>
<i>Backreferences</i>.
As mentioned earlier, no one knows how to 
implement regular expressions with backreferences efficiently,
though no one can prove that it's impossible either.
(Specifically, the 
<a href="http://perl.plover.com/NPC/NPC-3SAT.html">problem is NP-complete</a>, meaning that if
someone did find an efficient implementation, that would
be <i>major</i> news to computer scientists and would
win a <a href="http://www.claymath.org/Popular_Lectures/Minesweeper/">million dollar prize</a>.)
The simplest, most effective strategy for backreferences,
taken by the original awk and egrep, is not to implement them.
This strategy is no longer practical: users have come to
rely on backreferences for at least occasional use,
and backreferences are part of
the
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/xbd_chap09.html">POSIX standard for regular expressions</a>.
Even so, it would be reasonable to use Thompson's NFA simulation
for most regular expressions, and only bring out
backtracking when it is needed.
A particularly clever implementation could combine the two,
resorting to backtracking only to accommodate the backreferences.
</p>

<p class=pp>
<i>Backtracking with memoization</i>.
Perl's approach of using memoization to avoid exponential blowup
during backtracking
when possible is a good one.  At least in theory, it should make
Perl's regular expressions behave more like an NFA and
less like backtracking.  
Memoization does not completely solve the problem, though:
the memoization itself requires a memory footprint roughly 
equal to the size of the text times the size of the regular expression.
Memoization also does not address the issue of the stack space used
by backtracking, which is linear in the size of the text:
matching long strings typically causes a backtracking
implementation to run out of stack space:
</p><pre class=p1>
$ perl -e '("a" x 100000) =~ /^(ab?)*$/;'
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
$
</pre>

<p class=pp>
<i>Character sets</i>.
Modern regular expression implementations must deal with 
large non-ASCII character sets such as Unicode.
The 
<a href="http://swtch.com/plan9port/unix/"
>Plan 9 regular expression library</a>
incorporates Unicode by running an NFA with a
single Unicode character as the input character for each step.
That library separates the running of the NFA from decoding
the input, so that the same regular expression matching code
is used for both 
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/utf.html">UTF-8</a>
and wide-character inputs.

McNaughton and Yamada's construction

The approach used above, mimicking Thompson,
encodes the choices with explicit choice

was for his QED editor running on the CTSS 
[<a href="#vanvleck">10</a>]
operating
system on the IBM 7094.
<a name="pierce-b"></a>A copy of the editor can be found in archived CTSS sources
[<a href="#pierce">5</a>].
<a name="deutsch-lampson-b"></a>L. Peter Deutsch and Butler Lampson
[<a href="#deutsch-lampson">1</a>]
developed the first QED, but
Thompson's reimplementation was the first to use
regular expressions.
<a name="ritchie-b"></a>Dennis Ritchie, author of yet another QED implementation,
has documented the early history of the QED editor
[<a href="#ritchie">8</a>]
(Thompson, Ritchie, and Lampson later won
Turing awards for work unrelated to QED or finite automata.)
</p>

<p class=pp>
Thompson's paper marked the 
beginning of a long line of regular expression implementations.
Thompson chose not to use his algorithm when 
implementing the text editor ed, which appeared in 
First Edition Unix (1971), or in its descendant grep,
which first appeared in the Fourth Edition (1973).
Instead, these venerable Unix tools used
recursive backtracking!
Backtracking was justifiable because the
regular expression syntax was quite limited:
it omitted grouping parentheses and the
<code>|</code>,
<code>?</code>,
and
<code>+</code>
operators.
Al Aho's egrep,
which first appeared in the Seventh Edition (1979),
was the first Unix tool to provide
the full regular expression syntax, using a
precomputed DFA.
By the Eighth Edition (1985), egrep computed the DFA on the fly,
like the implementation given above.

<p class=pp>
<a name="pike-b"></a>While writing the text editor sam 
[<a href="#pike">6</a>]
in the early 1980s,
Rob Pike wrote a new regular expression implementation,
which Dave Presotto extracted into a library that 
appeared in the Eighth Edition.
Pike's implementation
incorporated submatch tracking into an efficient NFA simulation
but, like the rest of the Eighth Edition source, was not widely
distributed.
Pike himself did not realize that his technique was anything new.
Henry Spencer reimplemented the Eighth Edition library
interface from scratch, but using backtracking,
and
<a href="http://arglist.com/regex/">released his implementation</a>
into the public domain.
It became very widely used, eventually serving as the basis
for the slow regular expression implementations
mentioned earlier: Perl, PCRE, Python, and so on.
(In his defense,
Spencer knew the routines could be slow,
and he didn't know that a more efficient algorithm existed.
He even warned in the documentation,
&ldquo;Many users have found the speed perfectly adequate,
although replacing the insides of egrep with this code
would be a mistake.&rdquo;)
Pike's regular expression implementation, extended to
support Unicode, was made freely available
with sam in 
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.research/msg/f1783504a2d18051">late 1992</a>,
but the particularly efficient
regular expression search algorithm went unnoticed.
The code is now available in many forms: as 
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sources/plan9/sys/src/cmd/sam/">part of sam</a>,
as 
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sources/plan9/sys/src/libregexp/">Plan&nbsp;9's regular expression library</a>,
or
<a href="http://swtch.com/plan9port/unix/">packaged separately for Unix</a>.
<a name="laurikari-b"></a>Ville Laurikari independently discovered Pike's algorithm
in 1999, developing a theoretical foundation as well
[<a href="#laurikari">2</a>].
</p>


<p class=pp>
Finally, any discussion of regular expressions
would be incomplete without mentioning 
Jeffrey Friedl's book
<i>Mastering Regular Expressions</i>,
perhaps the most popular reference among today's programmers.
Friedl's book teaches programmers how best to use today's
regular expression implementations, but not how best to implement them.
What little text it devotes to implementation
issues perpetuates the widespread belief that recursive backtracking
is the only way to simulate an NFA.
Friedl makes it clear that he 
<a href="http://regex.info/blog/2006-09-15/248"
>neither understands nor respects</a>
the underlying theory.

Summary
</h2>

<p class=pp>
Regular expression matching can be simple and fast, using
finite automata-based techniques that have been known for decades.
In contrast, Perl, PCRE, Python, Ruby, Java,
and many other languages
have regular expression implementations based on 
recursive backtracking that are simple but can be
excruciatingly slow.
With the exception of backreferences, the features
provided by the slow backtracking implementations
can be provided by the automata-based implementations
at dramatically faster, more consistent speeds.
